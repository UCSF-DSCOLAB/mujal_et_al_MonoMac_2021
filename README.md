# Holistic Characterization of Tumor Monocyte-to-Macrophage Differentiation Integrates Distinct Immune Phenotypes in Kidney Cancer

This repository contains all code used to process and illustrate figured used in the unpublished BioRxiv .

The repository is organized as
```
base
  |- auxiliary_files (Various Files used during the analysis)
  |
  |- auxiliary_scripts (Various Scripts sourced during the analysis)
  |
  |- *.R (R scripts)
  |
  +- README.Md (This file)
```

All code has been thoroughly documented to describe major code functions. 

Certain paths to files and scripts *may* be pointing to the files within our system, but the files/scripts themselves will be within the appropriate auxiliary_* folder within this repository.

All single cell sequencing data will be retrievable at publication time through GEO.
